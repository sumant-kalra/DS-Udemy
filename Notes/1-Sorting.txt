[0] Analysis criteria: [Time Complexity; Space Complexity; Adaptive; Stability]
    1. Time Complexity: number(Comparisons)
        Two operations for sorting, count each of them
        (a) Comparison
        (b) Swap
        Comparison will always be performed whereas swap is performed after the comparison fails
    2. Space Complexity: Auxillary Space
        Extra Space Consumption
    3. Adaptive
        Better time complexity if the list is already sorted
    4. Stability
        Duplicate elements should retain their relative order.
        Required because if the list was already sorted based on some other criteria then relative order of 
        duplicates should be maintained after re-sorting.

[1] Sorting Techniques:
    (a) Comparison based sorts
        1.  Bubble sort      O(n2)
        2.  Insertion sort   O(n2)
        3.  Selection sort   O(n2)
        4.  Heap sort        O(nlogn)
        5.  Merge sort       O(nlogn)
        6.  Quick sort       O(nlogn)
        7.  Tree sort        O(nlogn)
        8.  Shell sort       O(n3/2)
    (b) Index based sorts
        9.  Count sort       O(n)
        10. Bucket/Bin sort  O(n)
        11. Radix sort       o(n)    
    
[2] (a) Define as per the name of algorithm
    (b) Analysis (4) for each pass and overall
